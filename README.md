# So

I meowed at the server
`curl -X MEOW https://...`

...and it meows back??
`meww mroow pUrrRrR :3`

...infinitely?????
`mrr mew >////< prrr`

# I want that cat
1. build it with cargo or use docker image
2. set env vars `CAT_ADDRESS`, `CAT_PORT` (defaults to `127.0.0.1` and `8080`)
3. if needed, setup reverse proxy to send MEOW requests to service
4. meow at your server to test it works (may hang a bit, pls wait for buffers to flush)
